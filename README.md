# DeepSeek Janus Model Colab Notebook

This repository provides a Google Colab notebook to run the **DeepSeek Janus Model** with full precision (non-quantized). This is an unofficial implementation designed for researchers and developers.

**Official DeepSeek Janus Repository**: [deepseek-ai/Janus](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus)

---
## ðŸš¨ Critical Requirement
**Without model quantization**, this implementation requires:
- **A100 GPU**
- **Colab Pro/Paid tier** (free Colab GPUs insufficient)
- 16GB+ system RAM

---
## Overview
**DeepSeek Janus** is a cutting-edge multimodal model developed by DeepSeek AI. This Colab notebook provides:
- Full-precision implementation (no quantization)
- Direct integration with original model weights
- Hardware-optimized configuration for A100 GPUs

---
## Getting Started
1. **Access Colab Pro**:
   - Ensure you have Colab Pro or equivalent access with A100 availability
2. **Launch Notebook**:
